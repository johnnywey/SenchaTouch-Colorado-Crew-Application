### SenchaTouch Example Application

This is an application I was asked to build for the [Colorado Film and Video Association](http://www.cfva.com). 

It is meant to copy the basic functionality of another version of the application I wrote for native iOS (see [http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/colorado-production-crew/id361128521?mt=8](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/colorado-production-crew/id361128521?mt=8)) but using a common framework that would run on any modern phone.

I don't technically own the data, so I might have to take that down at some point. For now, however, it serves as a good example of a nice dataset.
