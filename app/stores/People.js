It could turn into a nightmare! Thanks to Carmichael Photography everything went smoothly. They had been collaborative, flexible and they provided us with an highly professional yet supportive crew. We can't but recommend Carmichael Photography.'Heres what the Director Joachim Hellinger of HelliVentures Filmproduktion had to say about his companys experience after he brought the German agency Beiersdorf AG to Colorado to shoot Hansplast Sport Band Aids with Denali Productions, Inc: Denali Productions operated as our service production during our commercial shoot in the USA, where we experienced great organization on all production levels, starting from the cast and location scouting to the shoot with an excellent crew. Bob Carmichael and Doug Millington are reliable and competent partners and brought to our project professionalism of the highest level. If we have the opportunity to shoot once more in the USA, we would be very glad to work again with Denali Productions.  If you have any questions, please dont hesitate to contact me by phone or email here in Munich.

If we have the opportunity to shoot once more in the USA, we would be very glad to work again with Denali Productions.
