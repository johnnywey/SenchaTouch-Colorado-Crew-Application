Another project was an extensive photo catalog shoot for the Rome, Italy clothing company Original Marine and a climbing spot for the Munich, Germany Production Company HelliVentures Filmprodukion.  Here's what the company Selection from Milan, Italy had to say regarding the Original Marine Still shoot in Colorado about Carmichael Photography:  ""The project was a challenge: more than 150 photos for two catalogues, 10 days of production, 35 models of which the 80% kids from 6 months to 13 years. It could turn into a nightmare! Thanks to Carmichael Photography everything went smoothly. They had been collaborative, flexible and they provided us with an highly professional yet supportive crew. We can't but recommend Carmichael Photography.""Heres what the Director Joachim Hellinger of HelliVentures Filmproduktion had to say about his companys experience after he brought the German agency Beiersdorf AG to Colorado to shoot Hansplast Sport Band Aids with Denali Productions, Inc: Denali Productions operated as our service production during our commercial shoot in the USA, where we experienced great organization on all production levels, starting from the cast and location scouting to the shoot with an excellent crew. Bob Carmichael and Doug Millington are reliable and competent partners and brought to our project professionalism of the highest level. If we have the opportunity to shoot once more in the USA, we would be very glad to work again with Denali Productions.  If you have any questions, please dont hesitate to contact me by phone or email here in Munich.

With tongue planted firmly in cheek, I was named a Barristers Best for Best use of maritime law in a landlocked state for the work I did on Whale Wars. Both my colleague, Ken Tolle, and I also won Barristers Bests for Best un-law firm because, as Law Week Colorado reported, [w]hen top-echelon entertainment attorneys Roper and Tolle left Moye White earlier this year to strike out on their own, they knew they wanted to break out of the traditional law firm mold. I provide advice and counsel to clients through all stages of the business lifecycle, from review and consultation on business plans, entity formation and structure, strategy and financing to ongoing operations including negotiation and drafting of contracts involving content licenses, production, affiliation, syndication, distribution, management, performance, publishing, recording, sponsorship, marketing, endorsement, talent, advertising and ad-sales. I also consult with clients on video streaming and digital rights management issues, with the goals of protecting their intellectual property and helping them achieve their business objectives. "SUPPORT SERVICES,Climbing-Consultants & Facilities,TERRAVIVA PRODUCTIONS,Alexandro RojasSanders,RojasSanders,720 3529406,Denver,80209,terraviva@live.com,SUPPORT SERVICES,Helicopter/Aerial Services,ATS Helicopter Services,Richard Westra,Westra,303-858-1359,Denver,80202,rwestra@atshelo.com,"Our commitment to professionalism, safety and excellent customer service has made ATS the fastest growing helicopter services company in the Rocky Mountain region.
