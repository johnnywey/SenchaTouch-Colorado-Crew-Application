Carmichael is also a professional still photographer. In 2009- 2010 he was nominated 5 times by the International Master Cup Color Awards in London.  Recently Carmichael Photography has advanced an exciting and new video format that incorporates Carmichaels film story telling and cinematography background with still images.   At the 2010 - 31st annual Telly Awards in Chicago, Carmichael won 7 Telly Awards under the category of online video for his video for the band Maroon 5 entitled STORY.  This video debuted on the Harlem Childrens Zone web site and was subsequently released to all of M5s social media outlets.  The technique is perfectly defined as new media.  This technique involves capture via high end still photography, film editing with After Affects software and a graphic illustration overlay.  We invite you to our web site to view samples of this technique on our landing page.   

Production Services: Denali Productions, Inc/Carmichael Photography will provide location scouting, competitive bidding, great crewing and top flight production management for all companies seeking service company connections either in Colorado or Alaska or beyond.

Another project was an extensive photo catalog shoot for the Rome, Italy clothing company Original Marine and a climbing spot for the Munich, Germany Production Company HelliVentures Filmprodukion.  

Here's what the company Selection from Milan, Italy had to say regarding the Original Marine Still shoot in Colorado about Carmichael Photography:  'The project was a challenge: more than 150 photos for two catalogues, 10 days of production, 35 models of which the 80% kids from 6 months to 13 years. It could turn into a nightmare! Thanks to Carmichael Photography everything went smoothly. They had been collaborative, flexible and they provided us with an highly professional yet supportive crew. We can't but recommend Carmichael Photography.'

Heres what the Director Joachim Hellinger of HelliVentures Filmproduktion had to say about his companys experience after he brought the German agency Beiersdorf AG to Colorado to shoot Hansplast Sport Band Aids with Denali Productions, Inc: 

Denali Productions operated as our service production during our commercial shoot in the USA, where we experienced great organization on all production levels, starting from the cast and location scouting to the shoot with an excellent crew. Bob Carmichael and Doug Millington are reliable and competent partners and brought to our project professionalism of the highest level. If we have the opportunity to shoot once more in the USA, we would be very glad to work again with Denali Productions.  If you have any questions, please dont hesitate to contact me by phone or email here in Munich.  Joachim Hellinger, HelliVentures Filmproduktion

An Academy Award nominated and Emmy winning documentary director. Carmichael's web site outlines the areas of expertise he and Denali Productions, Inc/Carmichael Photography bring to projects. Carmichael directs and shoots film or video motion pictures and award winning still photography.  

A partial client commercial client list includes: Maroon 5, AM/Octone Records, Merrill Lynch, Paramount Studios, Adidas Cologne, USMC, Bayer Aspirin, Molson Beer, Ballys, Ford, Cadillac, Sprite, Reebok, Disney World, Backpacker Magazine, Casio Watches, National Parks Conservations Association and Abbotts Labs. Carmichael specializes in extreme sports: climbing, automotive, conventional sports, snow and ice sports, marine shooting, and aerial photography.  Doug Millington is the company's veteran Colorado producer/UPM/and location scout, Doug can be reached at dm@bobcarmichael.com    

Carmichael is also a professional still photographer. In 2009- 2010 he was nominated 5 times by the International Master Cup Color Awards in London.  Recently Carmichael Photography has advanced an exciting and new video format that incorporates Carmichaels film story telling and cinematography background with still images.   At the 2010 - 31st annual Telly Awards in Chicago, Carmichael won 7 Telly Awards under the category of online video for his video for the band Maroon 5 entitled STORY.  This video debuted on the Harlem Childrens Zone web site and was subsequently released to all of M5s social media outlets.  The technique is perfectly defined as new media.  This technique involves capture via high end still photography, film editing with After Affects software and a graphic illustration overlay.  We invite you to our web site to view samples of this technique on our landing page.   

Production Services: Denali Productions, Inc/Carmichael Photography will provide location scouting, competitive bidding, great crewing and top flight production management for all companies seeking service company connections either in Colorado or Alaska or beyond. We welcome foreign agency and production company inquiries. Recent successful service projects involved a fast track Jockey International shoot requiring 200 stampeding horses and a top level celebrity spokesperson.  Another project was an extensive photo catalog shoot for the Rome, Italy clothing company Original Marine and a climbing spot for the Munich, Germany Production Company HelliVentures Filmprodukion.  

Here's what the company Selection from Milan, Italy had to say regarding the Original Marine Still shoot in Colorado about Carmichael Photography:  'The project was a challenge: more than 150 photos for two catalogues, 10 days of production, 35 models of which the 80% kids from 6 months to 13 years. It could turn into a nightmare! Thanks to Carmichael Photography everything went smoothly. They had been collaborative, flexible and they provided us with an highly professional yet supportive crew. We can't but recommend Carmichael Photography.'

Heres what the Director Joachim Hellinger of HelliVentures Filmproduktion had to say about his companys experience after he brought the German agency Beiersdorf AG to Colorado to shoot Hansplast Sport Band Aids with Denali Productions, Inc: 

Denali Productions operated as our service production during our commercial shoot in the USA, where we experienced great organization on all production levels, starting from the cast and location scouting to the shoot with an excellent crew. Bob Carmichael and Doug Millington are reliable and competent partners and brought to our project professionalism of the highest level. If we have the opportunity to shoot once more in the USA, we would be very glad to work again with Denali Productions.  If you have any questions, please dont hesitate to contact me by phone or email here in Munich.  Joachim Hellinger, HelliVentures Filmproduktion

An Academy Award nominated and Emmy winning documentary director. Carmichael's web site outlines the areas of expertise he and Denali Productions, Inc/Carmichael Photography bring to projects. Carmichael directs and shoots film or video motion pictures and award winning still photography.  

A partial client commercial client list includes: Maroon 5, AM/Octone Records, Merrill Lynch, Paramount Studios, Adidas Cologne, USMC, Bayer Aspirin, Molson Beer, Ballys, Ford, Cadillac, Sprite, Reebok, Disney World, Backpacker Magazine, Casio Watches, National Parks Conservations Association and Abbotts Labs. Carmichael specializes in extreme sports: climbing, automotive, conventional sports, snow and ice sports, marine shooting, and aerial photography.  Doug Millington is the company's veteran Colorado producer/UPM/and location scout, Doug can be reached at dm@bobcarmichael.com    

Carmichael is also a professional still photographer. In 2009- 2010 he was nominated 5 times by the International Master Cup Color Awards in London.  Recently Carmichael Photography has advanced an exciting and new video format that incorporates Carmichaels film story telling and cinematography background with still images.   At the 2010 - 31st annual Telly Awards in Chicago, Carmichael won 7 Telly Awards under the category of online video for his video for the band Maroon 5 entitled STORY.  This video debuted on the Harlem Childrens Zone web site and was subsequently released to all of M5s social media outlets.  The technique is perfectly defined as new media.  This technique involves capture via high end still photography, film editing with After Affects software and a graphic illustration overlay.  We invite you to our web site to view samples of this technique on our landing page.   

Production Services: Denali Productions, Inc/Carmichael Photography will provide location scouting, competitive bidding, great crewing and top flight production management for all companies seeking service company connections either in Colorado or Alaska or beyond. We welcome foreign agency and production company inquiries. Recent successful service projects involved a fast track Jockey International shoot requiring 200 stampeding horses and a top level celebrity spokesperson.  Another project was an extensive photo catalog shoot for the Rome, Italy clothing company Original Marine and a climbing spot for the Munich, Germany Production Company HelliVentures Filmprodukion.  

Here's what the company Selection from Milan, Italy had to say regarding the Original Marine Still shoot in Colorado about Carmichael Photography:  'The project was a challenge: more than 150 photos for two catalogues, 10 days of production, 35 models of which the 80% kids from 6 months to 13 years. It could turn into a nightmare! Thanks to Carmichael Photography everything went smoothly. They had been collaborative, flexible and they provided us with an highly professional yet supportive crew. We can't but recommend Carmichael Photography.'

Heres what the Director Joachim Hellinger of HelliVentures Filmproduktion had to say about his companys experience after he brought the German agency Beiersdorf AG to Colorado to shoot Hansplast Sport Band Aids with Denali Productions, Inc: 

Denali Productions operated as our service production during our commercial shoot in the USA, where we experienced great organization on all production levels, starting from the cast and location scouting to the shoot with an excellent crew. Bob Carmichael and Doug Millington are reliable and competent partners and brought to our project professionalism of the highest level. If we have the opportunity to shoot once more in the USA, we would be very glad to work again with Denali Productions.  If you have any questions, please dont hesitate to contact me by phone or email here in Munich.  Joachim Hellinger, HelliVentures Filmproduktion

Carmichael is also a professional still photographer. In 2009- 2010 he was nominated 5 times by the International Master Cup Color Awards in London.  Recently Carmichael Photography has advanced an exciting and new video format that incorporates Carmichaels film story telling and cinematography background with still images.   At the 2010 - 31st annual Telly Awards in Chicago, Carmichael won 7 Telly Awards under the category of online video for his video for the band Maroon 5 entitled STORY.  This video debuted on the Harlem Childrens Zone web site and was subsequently released to all of M5s social media outlets.  The technique is perfectly defined as new media.  This technique involves capture via high end still photography, film editing with After Affects software and a graphic illustration overlay.

Production Services: Denali Productions, Inc/Carmichael Photography will provide location scouting, competitive bidding, great crewing and top flight production management for all companies seeking service company connections either in Colorado or Alaska or beyond.

Another project was an extensive photo catalog shoot for the Rome, Italy clothing company Original Marine and a climbing spot for the Munich, Germany Production Company HelliVentures Filmprodukion.  

Here's what the company Selection from Milan, Italy had to say regarding the Original Marine Still shoot in Colorado about Carmichael Photography:  'The project was a challenge: more than 150 photos for two catalogues, 10 days of production, 35 models of which the 80% kids from 6 months to 13 years. It could turn into a nightmare! Thanks to Carmichael Photography everything went smoothly. They had been collaborative, flexible and they provided us with an highly professional yet supportive crew. We can't but recommend Carmichael Photography.'

Heres what the Director Joachim Hellinger of HelliVentures Filmproduktion had to say about his companys experience after he brought the German agency Beiersdorf AG to Colorado to shoot Hansplast Sport Band Aids with Denali Productions, Inc: 

Denali Productions operated as our service production during our commercial shoot in the USA, where we experienced great organization on all production levels, starting from the cast and location scouting to the shoot with an excellent crew. Bob Carmichael and Doug Millington are reliable and competent partners and brought to our project professionalism of the highest level. If we have the opportunity to shoot once more in the USA, we would be very glad to work again with Denali Productions.  If you have any questions, please dont hesitate to contact me by phone or email here in Munich.  Joachim Hellinger, HelliVentures Filmproduktion

Here's what the company Selection from Milan, Italy had to say regarding the Original Marine Still shoot in Colorado about Carmichael Photography:  'The project was a challenge: more than 150 photos for two catalogues, 10 days of production, 35 models of which the 80% kids from 6 months to 13 years. It could turn into a nightmare! Thanks to Carmichael Photography everything went smoothly. They had been collaborative, flexible and they provided us with an highly professional yet supportive crew. We can't but recommend Carmichael Photography.'

Heres what the Director Joachim Hellinger of HelliVentures Filmproduktion had to say about his companys experience after he brought the German agency Beiersdorf AG to Colorado to shoot Hansplast Sport Band Aids with Denali Productions, Inc: 

Denali Productions operated as our service production during our commercial shoot in the USA, where we experienced great organization on all production levels, starting from the cast and location scouting to the shoot with an excellent crew. Bob Carmichael and Doug Millington are reliable and competent partners and brought to our project professionalism of the highest level. If we have the opportunity to shoot once more in the USA, we would be very glad to work again with Denali Productions.

Carmichael is also a professional still photographer. In 2009- 2010 he was nominated 5 times by the International Master Cup Color Awards in London.  Recently Carmichael Photography has advanced an exciting and new video format that incorporates Carmichaels film story telling and cinematography background with still images.   At the 2010 - 31st annual Telly Awards in Chicago, Carmichael won 7 Telly Awards under the category of online video for his video for the band Maroon 5 entitled STORY.  This video debuted on the Harlem Childrens Zone web site and was subsequently released to all of M5s social media outlets.  The technique is perfectly defined as new media.

Another project was an extensive photo catalog shoot for the Rome, Italy clothing company Original Marine and a climbing spot for the Munich, Germany Production Company HelliVentures Filmprodukion.  

Here's what the company Selection from Milan, Italy had to say regarding the Original Marine Still shoot in Colorado about Carmichael Photography:  'The project was a challenge: more than 150 photos for two catalogues, 10 days of production, 35 models of which the 80% kids from 6 months to 13 years. It could turn into a nightmare! Thanks to Carmichael Photography everything went smoothly. They had been collaborative, flexible and they provided us with an highly professional yet supportive crew. We can't but recommend Carmichael Photography.'

Heres what the Director Joachim Hellinger of HelliVentures Filmproduktion had to say about his companys experience after he brought the German agency Beiersdorf AG to Colorado to shoot Hansplast Sport Band Aids with Denali Productions, Inc: 

Denali Productions operated as our service production during our commercial shoot in the USA, where we experienced great organization on all production levels, starting from the cast and location scouting to the shoot with an excellent crew. Bob Carmichael and Doug Millington are reliable and competent partners and brought to our project professionalism of the highest level. If we have the opportunity to shoot once more in the USA, we would be very glad to work again with Denali Productions.  If you have any questions, please dont hesitate to contact me by phone or email here in Munich.  Joachim Hellinger, HelliVentures Filmproduktion

I work with individuals and companies in both traditional and new media (e.g., cable, satellite, Internet, and all forms of wire-line and wireless digital distribution) in a wide range of business and legal affairs. My clients include authors, artists, musicians, performers, athletes, sculptors, graphic designers, photographers, production companies, advertising agencies, publishers, Internet companies, software developers and website designers.

Law Week Colorado recently published its annual Barristers Best awards for 2009. With tongue planted firmly in cheek, I was named a Barristers Best for Best use of maritime law in a landlocked state for the work I did on Whale Wars. Both my colleague, Ken Tolle, and I also won Barristers Bests for Best un-law firm because, as Law Week Colorado reported, [w]hen top-echelon entertainment attorneys Roper and Tolle left Moye White earlier this year to strike out on their own, they knew they wanted to break out of the traditional law firm mold. 

I provide advice and counsel to clients through all stages of the business lifecycle, from review and consultation on business plans, entity formation and structure, strategy and financing to ongoing operations including negotiation and drafting of contracts involving content licenses, production, affiliation, syndication, distribution, management, performance, publishing, recording, sponsorship, marketing, endorsement, talent, advertising and ad-sales. I also consult with clients on video streaming and digital rights management issues, with the goals of protecting their intellectual property and helping them achieve their business objectives.
